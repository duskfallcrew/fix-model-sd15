# fix-model-sd15
Welcome to our collaborative work-in-progress Jupyter Notebook! 

ðŸš§ Here, we're diving into the task of smoothing out those model wrinkles before transforming them into diffusers. 

But, here's the scoop: it's still a work in progress. We're currently in the process of patching things up from Colab to Jupyter, so it's not running smoothly just yet. But hey, if you're a fellow developer with a knack for coding and want to lend a hand, we'd love to have you onboard! Let's make this project shine together!

The primary aim of this project is to address key discrepancies within the dictionary component of the model. A significant number of our SD 1.5 models have been affected by this issue, and there's a possibility that it might extend to future SDXL models. However, its compatibility with other architectures remains uncertain.

Currently, the project functions effectively on Google Colab, but our focus is on adapting it for seamless operation on Jupyter. It's worth noting that recent changes to Colab's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) have introduced challenges, catching users off guard and slowing down their workflow unexpectedly.
